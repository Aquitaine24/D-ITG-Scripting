# ITGSend Test Automation Scripts

This repository contains scripts for automating network performance tests using ITGSend and decoding the resulting logs with ITGDec. The scripts support both asynchronous and simultaneous test modes for IPv4 and IPv6, with variable packet sizes and protocols.

## Directory Structure

- `asynchronous.sh`  
  Runs ITGSend tests asynchronously for different protocols, packet sizes, and IP addresses. Each run generates a separate log file.

- `simultaneous.sh`  
  Runs ITGSend tests simultaneously for each combination of protocol and packet size, using a fixed `-C` value.

- `simultaneous_variable_C_Value.sh`  
  Similar to `simultaneous.sh`, but uses a variable `-C` value depending on the packet size.

- `decode_asynchronous.py`  
  Decodes and parses log files generated by `asynchronous.sh`, saving results to CSV files.

- `decode_simultaneous.py`  
  Decodes and parses log files generated by the simultaneous scripts, saving results to CSV files.

## Usage

### 1. Run Tests

Make the desired shell script executable and run it:

```sh
chmod +x asynchronous.sh
./asynchronous.sh
```

Or for simultaneous tests:

```sh
chmod +x simultaneous.sh
./simultaneous.sh
```

Or with variable `-C` values:

```sh
chmod +x simultaneous_variable_C_Value.sh
./simultaneous_variable_C_Value.sh
```

### 2. Decode Logs

After running the tests, decode the logs and export results to CSV:

For asynchronous logs:

```sh
python3 decode_asynchronous.py
```

For simultaneous logs:

```sh
python3 decode_simultaneous.py
```

### 3. Output

- Decoded results are saved as `ditg_ipv4_results.csv` and `ditg_ipv6_results.csv` in the current directory.

## Requirements

- ITGSend and ITGDec must be installed and available in your system's PATH.
- Python 3.x for the decoding scripts.
- Ensure the log directory (`/home/client-2/Desktop/LOGS/`) exists and is writable.

## Notes

- Adjust IP addresses, log paths, and other parameters in the scripts as needed for your environment.
- The scripts are designed for batch testing and automated result
